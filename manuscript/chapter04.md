# Components of the model

This chapter present the conceptual components of the ethics model:
* Aspirations
* Affordances
* Capabilities

I find that in this model, the three notions should be conceived as something that resides within the individual. Aspirations, Affordances and Capabilities I define here only exist in the mind of the individual. Of course, it is possible to discuss and share those with others, but these are of different nature that those I explain below. For example, one could suggest an aspiration or an affordance to someone, but if this second person does not see it as an their own aspiration or affordance, they simply are not. This raises the question on how we can study or event discuss such matters, since they only exist within the self. In the sense, this raises the same question as to the colour or the odour of things. How we know if what we see as blue is the same as what others see as blue? Empathy, again, might be the key. Based on a shared personal experience, we can associate one explanation of aspirations, affordance and capabilities. Those share personal experience also serve in fact to create a bound between individuals. Because we conceive aspirations, affordances and capabilities to be something we can have in common, we become one with others. This could explain why it is easier to “relate” to people with whom we “share” aspirations, even if this does not mean that this person will provide us in any way with an (social) affordance. At least, we can “relate”. Likewise, we relate to those with whom we share capabilities, even though they might be our “competitors”, and we relate with those with whom we share affordances. The sharing of affordances can also introduce competition if these are perceived as resources (affordances that are limited in usage) or cooperation if these are commons (affordances which need maintenance). **The model therefore also not only explains agency, be also how we build social relatedness.**

The **capability** to relate is however honed over time, like **empathy**, **care** and **solicitude**. While these are honed, they are also triggered by **aspirations** and **affordances**. In fact, the **capability** to care fosters **aspiration** for the wellbeing of others, or vice-versa. The model builds on this iterative process between the three components. Hence, the **capability** to care for other will foster the **invention** of **affordances**  to actualise the **aspiration** for their wellbeing, just as the latter will depend on the availability of **affordances** and our **capability** to invent or find those **affordances** in our **environment**

# Aspirations, Affordances and Capabilities

Social theory defines agency as the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices. From a systemic approach, agency can be divided into three basic dimensions: *aspirations*, *affordances* and *capabilities*. Aspirations define towards what agency leans, affordances, the social and material field onto which it clings, and capabilities, the unfolding by which it operates.

Are there other dimensions to agency? All theories of agency admit, in one way or another, the central place of capabilities to explain choices and actions. An actor’s agency would be bound to what they are capable to perform with the means they have. The basic analysis of agency, whether in everyday life or in the study of complex systems, therefore consists in identifying how the overlap between cognitive and material ressources can maximize utility. Social research often define actors in term of what they achieve for themselves and for the group. The Marxist approach sees capabilities as inherent to social stratification through class awareness and self-determination. The structuralist approach determines capabilities within a broader system that defines their value. For post-structuralist, however, individuals hold the power to develop capabilities that allow them to relocate in an ever-changing context. This is how the opposition between rich and poor, which once defined power and justice, made place to more non-deterministic forms of political contentions. And as a result, ethics rose as a necessary beacon for navigating subsequent moral upheavals.

These definitions have two ontological implications. On the one hand, individuals remain inseparable from their environment, as their capabilities always implies a form of interrelation with other humans or with non humans: actors constantly modify the world, either physically or cognitively. Every action thus ripples through space and time and cannot be conceived as isolated. On the other hand, every actions is functionally bound to the single individual who possesses the necessary capacity to act. Acting without capabilities is not an action that lacks of something, but rather a very different kind of action, maybe even a non-action. 

Thinking of agency in those terms is not as simple as it may seem. Capabilities imply that individuals make one with their environment and that any action is bound to ethics. Moreover, capabilities do not exist on their own; outside of action, they become meaningless. Hence the consubstantiality of ethics and agency: if you change the ethical framework of an action, it becomes a different action. The idea of action without ethics is not a concept, it’s an abstraction.

The difficulty to combine and articulate different ethical frameworks comes from the transformative effect it has on each individual's agency. Philosophers and policymakers who believe that we can create ethical frameworks for the mass like we apply laws and regulations should reconsider what are the limits of the paradigm that turns ethics into norms.

The two other dimensions of agency are less commonly discussed. We could, for example ignore the notion of aspiration by considering that the same action would result from different desires and obligations. Consequentialism for example does not take into account what drives actions but only their outcome. Similarly, deontology also does not give too much importance to aspirations as long as actions respect given norms. As for virtue ethics, it depletes agency from any non-idealistic motivation. Yet, we still act despite foreseeing negative consequences, breaking of rules and down-to-earth yearnings. Thus aspirations provide another dimension of the ethics of agency, which are, if not normative in themselves, a powerful entry point to understand the relationship between actors and their action.

The notion of affordance appears indissociable from action. Laws of physics state that to any action there is a reaction. Formulated otherwise, we could say that any action and reaction are interdependent. Therefore to act—and as mentioned above, we always act unto something—, we need something else to react. This other thing is an affordance. While the most obvious examples of this are objects such as tools and surfaces, these represent a very small fraction of the affordances needed to conduct agency. Affordances can also be social such as the people we engage with, but even entirely immaterial like ideas and memories.

Could we imagine aspirations to be part of affordances? We probably could, the same way that we confine our desires with others to receive their support. The reason I suggest to keep this triadic model is that in looking at the direct interactions between these three dimensions, we might want to consider the interdependency between aspirations/affordances, affordances/capabilities and capabilities/aspirations. For this last couple, capabilities suppose a concrete action, and therefore an aspiration to drive the action, but if we can invent several affordances (in a cityscape for example), we can develop complex aspirations that require many capabilities. In this context, we can conceive diverse sets of aspirations, with different ways to sharing affordances, but this sharing operates thank to the capability of each actor to articulate their use of affordances harmoniously in a given environment. The distinction between aspirations and affordances thus result from the a capability of societies to generate collective agency: each individual agency combines with others to form various levels of collective agencies, that in turn can also interact with one another across levels and degrees of complexity. 

## How the model works (each dimension feeds the other)

The same way we can conceive an aspiration as a affordance, affordances can become capabilities and capabilities, aspirations, and vice-versa. Such deconstruction of *a priori* embedded in social representations, turn the model into a powerful tool to analyze dynamics of agency. For example, we could easily label cooking as a capability. But someone can aspire to cook or to hone their skills in cooking. Alternatively, they can use cooking as a discussion topic, thus affording to a social situation. Cooking is therefore more than just a skill. But what about material affordances, like a stone? Can we consider them as aspirations or capabilities? Take Robinson for example, who, strayed on an island, looks for a stone to crush a coconut. In this example, the stone becomes successively an aspiration, an affordance and a capability. While this example may seem trivial, the same logic applies to much more abstract and complex sets of action.

The possibility for a given concept or object to be described as one dimension of agency or another should not be mistaken with the relationship that each dimension has with the two others. Each dimension can offer a different viewpoint of the same thing, like in the example I gave with Robinson’s stone. But in this example, we understand there is a certain logic in how these dimensions evolve in relation to one another. In short, we could say that aspirations, affordances and capability are co-dependent. They feed on and stimulate each other. This “interaction” between the three dimensions is what generates agency. Figure 1 shows how aspirations, affordances and capabilities generate one another.

*Fig. 1: Interaction Between Dimensions of Agency*

### Aspirations / Affordances
In the example of Robinson, we see how the stone can be both an aspiration and an affordance to the protagonist’s agency. But  the tale is also full of other aspirations and affordances, which remain undisclosed. What could leads Robinson to crash the coconut? Hunger, survival, the hope to see his family and friends again are a few examples.

Likewise, Robinson uses a variety of affordances in his action. Some he uses consciously and some he uses unconsciously: the ground, against which he crashes the coconut, his arm that powers the gesture [!! Develop notion of “embodied affordances” to talk about limbs and physical attributes, eg. beautiful hair and features!!], even the sunlight, which allow him to see what he is doing, etc. A simple action as this requires all these affordances. Many of those being common to any actions, like the air we breath, that we tend to only consider them in life threatening situations [!! Develop notion of “vital affordances”!!]. Table x. Shows an axiomatic typology of affordances and examples that correspond to each type.

## Organizing the dimensions of agency

Aspirations, affordances and capabilities are infinite. Aspirations: Motivation can be bodily or idealistic. Affordances: We can use objects, people, signs and ideas. Capabilities: Skill and aptitude that combine our know-how and the ability to act. As a general rule, we can classify the three dimensions according to different sets of values. The following tables give these values and examples for each of their combinations.

*Table 1: Aspirations value space*
|          | Basic       | Abstract      |
|----------|------------ |---------------|
| Selfish  | Sustenance  | Opportunities |
| Societal | Sollicitude | Justice       |

*Table 2: Affordances value space*
|             | Physical   | Social |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| Material   | Ressources | Labor  |
| Immaterial | Commons   | Norms |

*Table 3: Capabilities value space*
|             | Personal  | Extended |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Individual  | Movement | Motility | 
| Social      | Language  | Writting |

Why these values rather than other? In this axiomatic approach, they are best to describe the diversity of variations that exist in each dimension’s infinite space.

## Aspirations
Aspirations is a universal concept that describes a human reality: desire. From the moment we are born, we desire. The desire not to be exposed to light, the desire for warmth, the desire for food. Of course, only later can we begin conceptualizing, discerning and naming these desires, but this do not mean they do not exist from the moment we come into this world.

With time, our desire multiplies. We start wanting to be held, to be talked to, and to move things. Soon, we want affection, we crave certain food, we want to play with our toys. As we grow older, these aspirations become more abstract, like going to college, traveling, meeting the right person, etc.

While many of our aspirations concerns us, we also desire things for others. We desire our parents to be in good health and that friend to get the job they applied for. Aspirations can, in that sense, be selfless. The people we aspire for can be individuals but also groups. Hence, I can aspire for my students to suceed and find good jobs. I might project these aspirations unto them individually, in accordance to my relationship with each and everyone of them, but I also project these aspiration unto them as a group. Hence, the type of group can be more or less defined. For example, a given group of students is defined, while all students I have is slightly more abstract. I might want for all students — regardless if taught them or not — to succeed. 

While our feeling of desire might be bigger for ourselves and those we love, we also aspire the best for strangers... specific conflicts, society, etc.

Our desire may even apply to non-humans such as pet, or wild life, flora, and the environement. 

In general, aspirations follow two evolutionary paths: one concerns the distance to the self, and the second the degree of abstraction. In [Table 1], I give four examples that illustrate the range of aspirations from basic to abtract and from personal to distant. Unsurprisingly, basic aspirations correspond to those that we develop at an early stage in our life. These also correspond to the “basic needs” such as eating, clothing and shelter. The most basic personal aspirations are somewhat universal. On the other hand, aspirations for distant entities and abstract aspirations vary greatly from one individual to another. 

*Table 1: Aspiration matrix*
|          | Basic               | Abstract        |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Personal | Drinking water      | Going to heaven |
| Distant  | No animal suffering | Sustainability  |

[Table 1]:https://github.com/sjinko/theory/blob/master/manuscript/chapter04.md###chapter04-table01

The distinction between “aspirations”, “desires” and “wants” may seem thin, and it is. The reason why I use aspirations has to do with the seemingly more abstract nature of the notion. We often associate “desire” with a feeling or an uncontrolable urge. Wants are often opposed to needs, making them seem unecessary, superflous or frivolous. Aspiration, on the contrary are associated with greater ideals and with distant future, which may seem odd to speak of a baby’s aspiration to drink their mothers’ milk. Yet, as we will see, a basic and immediate desire and a greater abstract goal can be put on the same level of importance in given circumstances. Moreover, I argue–and this is one of the main point of this book—that we define distant and abstract aspirations through the same process than we define basic and personal ones: by our capabilities on perceived affordances.

### Where aspirations and desire split
Aspirations can be based on desire, but not only. They can also be based on obligation or constraint. For example, one may aspire to a certain status by sense of obligation, or indirectly to fulfil the aspiration of pleasing one’s parents, itself pushed by the aspiration to avoid conflict or feel secure.

The question of conflict should be discussed in details, especially in the context of urban life and governance. What is conflict in the framework of this model? **Conflict**, which should be an integral part of the model, as it is core to ethic. It would seem logic to say that conflict emerges when aspirations differs, when people want different things. But in fact conflict can also emerge when aspirations align. This could be case when capabilities and affordances are not shared, and that the “way” to actualised shared aspirations differs. In fact, most political issues arise not from sharing different aspirations, but honing different capabilities and inventing different affordances. Conflict can also be part of an **aspiration** actualisation process, and therefore embedded in agency. For example, creating conflict between parties can in fact produce affordances needed to actualise one aspirations. Yet, conflict may also emerge when a party does not have the capability to use or invent affordances in the **virtual** **conditions** that would result from the foreseen actualisation of the other’s **perceived** aspirations. In this case, **conflict** would serve to maintain **virtual** **conditions** for this the party can use its **capabilities** and **affordances** to actualise its **aspirations**.

What would be the difference between **aspirations** and **objectives**? Considering what I said about **conflict**, objectives are shared ensemble of **aspirations**, **affordances** and **capabilities**. They need to be shared to make sense, and this sharing entails a degree of **empathy** on each other‘s capabilities and affordances needed to reach these aspirations.


One‘s aspiration cannot be “in conflict” per see. However, the actualisation of certain aspirations may limit the invention of affordances or the honing of capabilities for another aspiration. Hence, when we feel that two or more of our aspirations are “in conflict”, we foresee that the actualisation of one generates **conditions** that **limit** the actualisation of the other. 

What does it mean to **limit** the actualisation of an aspiration? Again, the limitation of an aspiration has perhaps more to do with creating virtual environments since only invented affordances can really be put to use. Therefore, limiting the actualisation of an aspiration is an anticipation in which one is not able to invent affordance or does not hold the capability imagine how they would invent affordances in the future, and consider that this limitation is a transformation of the **environment** by themselves or by others.

This raises the question of what is the difference between **conditions** and **environment**. In short, **conditions** is the configuration of all three dimensions of agency (aspirations, capabilities and affordances), while **environment** only refers to the configuration of perceived affordances, but in relation to the capability and the aspiration of the individuals, since affordances don’t exist on their own!


This means that capabilities are also, in a sense, contextual, in a similar way that **affordances** are contextual (but also, so are aspirations, but more on that later). The model does not entail that capabilities are constantly active. Capabilities “surface” when needed, but otherwise lay dormant. Capabilities would correspond to what JL call “capital de stock”, that is the accumulation of **knowledge** and **know-how**. 

In this model, capabilities correspond to know-how. **Knowledge** takes a specific intermediary form in this model as it is the byproduct on the capability to produce **informational affordance** from the environment and the capability to retain this **informational affordance**. Here, I use the term **informational affordance** to highlight the fact that information is retrieved from **affordances**. Of course, the **information** can be passed down directly from one individual to another, the even this transmission process requires an **encoding** and a **decoding** of the information by a cognitive process by which both individuals have to rely on previous knowledge. For example, if I say “the cat is black”, my interlocutor and I both have to retrieve knowledge on what is a cat and what is black. This information relies on encoded memories of previous encounters of the sound “cat” and “black”.

Knowledge, once retain can be directly used as an affordance. Here, other capabilities such as synthesis, analysis, action-thinking, etc. put these affordances to use to achieve particular aspirations.


This prompts me to address the notion of “invites”, in relation to affordances. J. Rudler discussed the notion in her doctoral dissertation, but it was I. Sartoretti, having read parts of the dissertation who told me about it. I am not know exactly how J. Rudler uses the notion of “invites”, but from what I understand from my discussion with I. Sartoretti, these are **affordaces** that exist outside of the user and which “invite” him to use. The use of **invites** in this context mainly refers to artefacts conceive and actualized by a designer for use by the public. My main problem with this definition is that it presupposes that **affordances** exist outside of agency.  While I can consider that material artefacts are tangible realities that exist in materiality and geometry outside of the person’s mind, and that they are in that sense **shared realities**, I am not sure if the notion **invite** can be included in the model. Of course, **affordances** can also be non-material but social. What would be the notion of **invite** in this context? For example, if the state sets up an information desk, where people can retrieve information from clerks, it is setting somewhat of a **social invite**. But do invite have to be "set up", that is willfully conceived and put in place for a purpose? Can invite be somewhat fortuitous **configurations** which are commonly perceived for the same aspiration? For example, a tree falls into the wood is frequently used as a bench. Is this an "invite" even though nobody conceived the tree falling? How could we characterize this fortuitous configuration? Another example is a public bench, which is “misused” by sitting on its back and putting the feet on the seat. The bench was clearly designed with a purpose, but its geometry “invites” to another usage or other practices. Is there a difference between this bench and the fallen tree in the wood?

This opens up to a very important question of this book: if we can’t produce affordances for others, but only produce configuration which we consider of common usage, what is the relationship between the environment and the agency of actors? How does the transformation we operate in the **environment** relate to the agency of others? Can we “interact” directly on the agency of others, or all our interaction necessarily **mediated** by the environnement? In other words, can we relate? Is empathy real? Since we can’t really know of someone‘s aspirations, capabilities and (perceived) affordances (considered all together in balance within a complex system of aspirations, capabilities and affordances) what creates empathy? What does it mean to “empathize”? What is our relationship with “otherness”? 

### Aspirations are linked
One aspiration may lead to another. If I want to be successful, it might push me to want to make money, therefore have a good job, therefore go to university. Yet, I might also, instead of wanting to have a job, want to make a lot of money without going to university. 

### Building on aspirations
Aspirations can also be built from the bottom up.

### Introducing discrimination
The example of students is a good one because it allows me to introduce some bias. I might want all my students to succeed or all students to suceed, or I may think that only hard-working students should succeed. Instead, I could also aspire for all hard-working and naturally talented students to succeed. Why should students who are naturally gifted and do not have to work hard should fail?

Any aspiration discreminates. When I want something for myself, I want it for me, not for others. If I want something good to happen to my family or to some friends, I don’t wish it necessarily as muhc for other people. I may want the same for everybody, but let‘s just say I don’t care as much. Inversely, I may want something for strangers, but not necessarilly for people that I know. I may consider they don’t deserve it, or that it is no use to them.

### Priorizing aspirations
Not all aspirations are equal. We consider some aspiration of greater importance. Succeeding in life may seem to us more important than going for a burger. 

### Priority is contextual
We may favor one aspiration — say eating something when I am hungry — over another like going for a hike, even though I also want to hike. The way we prioritze aspirations is not absolute, but has to do with context. We would priorize our aspiration to eat if we are starving, over something we deem of greater importance like being true to a friend. Yet, we sometime face these situation where little things take a disproportionate size, as we say. 

### Aspirations depend on context
Let’s say I walk down the street. If the street happens to be by the parc, I may want to stroll thorugh the automn leaves. If on the street there is a store that caugh my eye, I might enter inside and buy something, something I had never thought of.  

### Modeling aspirations
Aspirations are virtual realities.

### Morality / Normative Ethics
Morality is the collectively defined hierarchy of aspirations. Morality help us navigate our aspirations, it’s to get rid of the need to think for ourselves. Hedonism tells us we have to prioritze our bodily aspirations. Utilitarism tells us to prioritize the many aspirations of the most people as possible.

### Guilt
When we go against this priority

## Affordances

Affordances allow us to actualise our aspirations by providing us with *material* (physical and ideal) that "does the job"?

To understand the relationship between aspiration and affordances, I might want to to observe practices. For example, if I am wearing a sanitary mask in public, it is to fill several aspirations: protect myself from contamination, obey social norm, conform to a practice that I deem valid. By opposition, I would not want to wear a plexiglas mask because I think it looks stupid, and it would make me stand out in public. Also, I am not sure of their efficiency. Therefore, the sanitary mask allow me to actualise these aspirations, as well as my aspiration to go out and, for example, my aspiration to go buy something. 


The quality of an affordance results of this “trade off” between various aspirations that, in a sense, even define the affordance.

Affordance need to be defined, first by being perceived. In fact, the perception of an affordance is rather its “invention” the same way we “invent” a treasure in French law. The affordance only exist at the moment it is conceived by its user.

Can affordances be perceived by many? Well, since all individuals have different sets of aspirations, the affordance itself may not be perceived collectively but it is possible to recognise that an artefact or a person represents an affordance for some one else. This relates to out capacity for **empathy**, that is to **project** unto others our aspirations (or is it the opposite?).


In politics, voters’ preferences relate to the affordance they invent for themselves in parties ideologies and platforms, candidates, etc. the more aspirations diverge, the more the invention of these affordance will be different between two people. The example of politics raises the question of the agency of politicians in shaping their platform to suit people’s aspirations. In a sense, to actualise their aspiration of being elected (which is linked to other aspirations on social status, income, power, etc.), politicians must provide affordances (or **invites** to take the term used by Irene in reference to Jade’s work) that will hopefully be invented into affordances by voters.

Populism would be defined here as the practice of systematically providing **invites** that suit non-societal aspirations of voters, while politics (by opposition) would be


Affordances can be of two types: limited or unlimited. When we speak of limited affordances, we can use the word “ressource”. Unlimited affordances are also of two types, those which we have to maintain, “commons”, and those that we do not have to maintain, like the wind, and for which I do not have yet a word.

# Capabilities

Capabilities reside in the knowledge of a set of practices and gestures, which, together, give the ability to use affordance in order to actualise aspirations. Capabilities are honed over time by individuals in relation to the affordances they find in their environment and the aspirations they have. The acquisition of capabilities can itself be an aspiration. 

One important set of capabilities relating to agency are capabilities that allow to invent aspirations, and those that allow to invent affordances. The capability to “invent" or to perceive affordances is necessary to individuals to actualise their aspirations. Likewise, there are capabilities to invent aspirations from the other capabilities and affordances one has. 

Is there multiple types of capabilities?

What are extended capabilities? They are capabilities that are external to the individual, but that they can use nonetheless. A common example of extended capability is to record information with pen and paper. Here, the person only has to remember where the information is located rather than remember the information. This system becomes even more efficient when the many of these externalised information supports are gathered at the same location. Then, the person only has to remember the single location of all these supports instead of each one of them. External capabilities can also include tools as well as other individuals. External capabilities can also in part be conceived as affordances. In our pen and paper example, the pen, the paper and the resulting list are affordances produced by the individual. By **encoding** **information** into the **environment**, the person also produces a configuration that can become an **affordance** for someone else. Hence, another person may also **use** this list to actualised their aspiration. In that case the list is not this second person’s extended capability but simply an affordance, which can be use and reused over time. Would that mean that extended capabilities only concern agents that generate them? Perhaps, because it requires a certain set of capability for this person to generate the extended capability and another set of capabilities for this person, or another person, to use this extended capability as affordance. 


What is aesthetics? Mirza Tursic defines aesthetics in term of expressions. In the context of this model, those expressions could correspond to multiple aspirations of the artist. Yet, aesthetics is not limited to art, as we also give aesthetical meaning to natural artefacts like landscapes, shiny stones, pleasing sounds and sensations. Here, aesthetics could be defined as a value given upon certain experiences, and the capability to produce these experience. Aesthetics would therefore also be a set of affordances consumed for their qualities. But what would be the corresponding aspirations? The enjoyment of aesthetics is in itself a complex set of aspirations. For example, the art historian, archeologist and commoner would not have the same aesthetical experience in looking certain artefacts. Aesthetics is linked to forms of knowledge, and as we have seen, knowledge correspond to affordances. There is therefore a capability to mobilise aesthetical knowledge to shape different experience into value. Those capabilities depend on training and previous knowledge. There is a sense of pleasure linked to the validation of the knowledge, which also induces legitimacy to the observer. Aesthetics would be a validation of the individual’s agency by validating its aspirations, affordances and capabilities. It is an experience of self-affirmation in which the individual is reconciled with its **agentic system**, its ethics. This would raise the question, is the aesthetic experience the same as the moral experience? While we do not necessarily suffer to “in-aesthetics”, we do associate suffering to “injustice”. In that sense, ethics and aesthetics provide types of experience. On the contrary, the aesthetic experience may be more enjoyable than the ethical experience. In other words, we are sensitive to aesthetic and injustice, but no to the country. We are drawn to aesthetic but repulsed by unethical situations. 

How can we explain, with the model that unethical situations create suffering but ethical situation do not provide enjoyable experience? (Is there a name for “ethical suffering”?) (In a discussion with G. Cousin, he argues that there can be a positive feeling associated with ethics, for example justice. A sort of “ethical enjoyment”). The question raise here is how does the model explain what moral suffering is. The model itself presents a theory of ethics, and so some extend, a model of morality. In the context, morality would form aspirations which the individual adheres. They are, in a sens, a condensed explanation of the model according to abstract principles. Morality is an ideal state of the environnement from the perspective of the individual. Moral principles are **ideal affordances** (prises idéelles) which facilitates the taking of decision by orienting agency towards a justifiable action. This would comply with the theory by O. S. Curry on morality as cultural strategies to increase cooperation and avoid conflict. Their theory could also be explained through the present model. 

But coming back the to moral sentiment. Or rather the moral suffering. We tend to attribute ethical suffering to a defined moral principle, this calling it moral suffering but it is really ethical suffering. This feeling takes place depending on the circumstances. A most common form or moral suffering is the feeling of injustice. How can we define this in term of ethical suffering, and ultimately in term of what happens to aspirations, affordances and capabilities, and in general to agency? 

A quick answer would be that ethical suffering emerges from the external preventing of moral aspirations. But then why would preventing moral aspirations result in a particularly intense form of suffering compared to the extern prevention of other aspirations? To this, I note that there is some advantages in speaking of “moral suffering”, since we associate these feeling with the infringement on morality, but also some advantages in speaking of “ethical suffering”, which is in line with the model. In fact, I should devote a section of the book to explaining the model’s relationship with morality through the “translation” of **moral suffering** to **ethical suffering**. The section could even be entitled “from moral to ethical suffering”. The section could cover question of injustice, indignation, moral deception and frustration.

In this context, how could I explain the powering of agency through moral/ethical suffering. How does it motivates us to act even more? Moral suffering surely seem like a powerful motivation to act. Here, I explain how what we describe as “moral suffering” can in fact enhance agency. Moral suffering results from the perceived violation of one’s moral framework (principle, values, etc.). Yet, it tends to occur in specific situations where the violation of the moral framework is tied to something that we care about (this prompts be to think of care as something that is distinct from morality, as we might not have strong feeling to the violation of care the same way we feel faced with the violation of justice, authority, purity and In-group [loyalty]). For example, the violation of justice would not create the same depending on the “degree” of sollicitude I have about the object of the violation. 

### Table 2: Intensity of moral emotion to justice/injustice
|              | Unjust  | Just    |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Sollicitude  | High    | Medium |
| Indifference | Medium | Low    |

Table 2 shows the intensity of moral emotion according to four paradigmatic situations. The degree of “sollicitude/indifference" refers to the object of the situation. The self, friends, close family members, my environnement, etc. In three of the situations, the intensity of the moral emotion is low. This table in fact illustrates two distinct mechanisms of moral emotions that are often considered as single mechanism. Moral emotions refers on the one hand to the enforcement or violation of moral frameworks (e.g. justice, care, in-group, purity, authority), and on the other hand to the object of this dynamic, for which we have more or less sollicitude (I avoid the common expression of ”care” to distinguish from the moral category). In my model, sollicitude could be directly explained in terms of aspirations, affordances and capabilities. 

Sollicitude—or the mediator that defines then intensity of moral emotions—will likely be affected by the intersection of our aspirations for the object of the situation. For example, we have sollicitude for our mother because many of our aspirations concern her. We might have sollicitude for the oppressed because their situation is also at the intersection of many of our aspirations. These aspirations, are, in turn, as we have seen previously defined by the capabilities and the affordances that we have. Hence, sollicitude is not a capability in itself (the same way that empathy is, for example), but the result of the intersectionality of our aspirations. Here, the object can also act as a symbolic mediator—an affordance—to our aspirations. For example, indigenous tribes in the Amazonia are not only object of my sollicitude but also mediators of my sollicitude for the Rain Forest, which is a mediator of my sollicitude for the environnement. The production of such **mediators** is however the results of certain capabilities, but also of our agency in general, which prompts us to establish virtual affordances to cognate abstract objects or situations, like “the environnement”. The relationship between these **mediators** of agency could be linked to Actor-Network Theory.

How can I describe space in term of my model?  The model is inherently spatial. Geographers have long theorized about space, bringing forward, through bits and pieces, a general understanding of space as a dimension of society. However, the frameworks they have put in place does not establish clear relation between space to action, limiting their capacity to channel their descriptive and analytical work into real world solutions. Architects, who have shaped their own theory of space apart from social theory, have mostly focused on the sensoriel manifestation of space, and thus constrain their practice to act on actions that relate specifically to those sensoriel manifestations. Other social disciplines, such as sociology, economics, anthropology and psychology also consider space, in one way or another. This “spatial turn” brought upon social theory a myriad of ideas and discourses about space. Yet, despite the multitude of work concerned with space, social researchers still lack a framework that would enable them to better understand how space and action relate, and thus translate their models into actionable objectives to fight against social inequalities, environmental injustice and anomy. This paper introduces such a framework, which can be deployed across social disciplines and operational fields like architecture, urban design and spatial planing. In the next few pages, you will discover how a general ethical framework provides solid grounds for greater exchanges and mutual enhancement between spatial research and practice. First, you will read on the recent development in spatial theory from geography and architecture. Second, you will be introduced to the ethical framework linking space and action. Third, you will be presented with the implication of this model across social research and design practices with emphasing on pressing urban issues of social inequalities, environmental injustice and show how the framework provides a plateforme for greater collaborations between social research and operational design towards a more sustainable society. The paper concludes on the utility of such model for advancing social theory into a proactive activity and solidify the institutional and economic position of social theory research in the knowledge economy.

Space has been the focus on social research since the Enlightenments. Hence, many of our common understanding of space in social science, such as geography, inherits from conceptions first laid out by philosophers such as Descartes (1596-1650), Spinoza (1632-1677), Leibniz (1646-1716) and Kant (1724-1804). Through their theory of ethics, aesthetics, science, the individual and society, these men have laid out of what would later become the conceptual foundation of Western academia.

Today, these early definitions of space are still commonly employed today. For examples, Descartes’ idea of space as a set of locations relative to each other can be associated with the idea of space as a set of coordinates. Leibniz, on the other hand had put forward a definition of space as a set of relationship between individuals. This abstract definition later gave birth to French critical geography as it still stands today.

Early social science, in the work of Max Weber, Georg Simmel, and Marx was built upon the concepts and ideas of space brought forward by Enlightenments philosophers.

There is an ongoing debate about how to define intelligence, with the aim of creating artificial intelligence systems that can learn like humans. Yan Le Cun suggested recently that intelligence should be conceived as the capacity to predict. Searl, opposed this view in suggesting that instead, intelligence should be defined as the capacity to...
In this paper, I suggest to conceive intelligence as the capacity to generate new aspirations for oneself. In other words, this would mean giving the machine the liberty to choose what it wants to accomplish, rather than defining for her what she should  do. Without the capacity to aspire, the development of artificial intelligence systems will stall. This does not mean that there won‘t be any innovation on the development of AI methods and technology. Keeping AI within its current paradigms is the best way to refine its efficiency and broader its application. A paradigm shift in AI would brings us back 10 years with the need to rethink completely how we can ask AI to perform certain tasks. Asking, not commanding, because an intelligent AI, like any animal would have its own agency. 
Current AI models are to plants what aspirational AI is to animals. If you know what to expect from your AI system, then it’s not intelligent enough. Intelligence is not the capacity to foresee but the capacity to create unforseeable outcomes.

%%% In other words, when aspirations become affordances they fuel motivation. On the other hand, the opposite results in our transformation of the environment. In both cases, possibility to do so  depends on the actor’s capability to operate this dimensional translation.
   


Such process of defining collective agency operates more or less explicitly horizontally and vertically. Horizontally, it encompasses every pairs of actors such as collective agency could be defined as:

Ach = n*(n-1)/2

where Ach is the number of horizontal collective agency and n the number of actors considered. Vertically, it encompasses every group size possible such as collective agency could be defined as:

Acv = (n-1)**2

Where Acv is the number of vertical collective agency. Combined, those result in the total number of collective agency possible defined as:

Agency could be considered in term of non-linear relationship between levels of agents.

One individual is level 1, two individuals is level 2, etc.
There is an infinity of levels since there is an infinity of agents.

For example, in a group of one, there is one agency of level 1, and none of the others. In a group of two, there is two level 1 and one level two. In a group of three, there is three level 1, three level 2 and one level 3. 

In addition, we should also consider each level of agency as an agent it itself. In that case, in a group of one, there is one level 1, and none of the others. In a group of two, there is two level 1 and three level 2. In a group of three, there is three level 1, eighteen level 2 and 




We could say the same of a given group of individuals who, by sharing an environment, remain in a constant state of competition and cooperation. 

These levels of agency
