# Components of the model

This chapter present the conceptual components of the ethics model:
* Aspirations
* Affordances
* Capabilities

## Aspirations
Aspirations is a universal concept that describes a human reality: desire. From the moment we are born, we desire. The desire not to be exposed to light, the desire for warth, the desire for food. Of course, only later can we begin conceptualizing, discerning and naming these desires, but this do not mean they do not exist from the moment we come into this world.

With time, our desire multiplies. We start wanting to be held, to be talked to, and to move things. Soon, we want affection, we crave certain food, we want to play with our toys. As we grow older, these aspirations become more abstract, like going to college, traveling, meeting the right person, etc.

While many of our aspirations concerns us, we may also desire things for others. We desire our parents to be happy, we want our friends to succeed...

While our feeling of desire might be bigger for ourselves and those we love, we also aspire the best for strangers... specific conflicts, society, etc.

Our desire may even apply to non-humans such as pet, or wild life, flora, and the environement. 

In general, aspirations follow two evolutionary paths: one concerns the distance to the self, and the second the degree of abstraction. In [Table 1], I give four examples that illustrate the range of aspirations from basic to abtract and from personal to distant. Unsurprisingly, basic aspirations correspond to those that we develop at an early stage in our life. These also correspond to the “basic needs” such as eating, clothing and shelter. The most basic personal aspirations are somewhat universal. On the other hand, aspirations for distant entities and abstract aspirations vary greatly from one individual to another. 

### Table 1: Aspiration matrix
|          | Basic               | Abstract        |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Personal | Drinking water      | Going to heaven |
| Distant  | No animal suffering | Sustainability  |

The distinction between “aspirations”, “desires” and “wants” may seem thin, and it is. The reason why I use aspirations has to do with the seemingly more abstract nature of the notion. We often associate “desire” with a feeling or an uncontrolable urge. Wants are often opposed to needs, making them seem unecessary, superflous or frivolous. Aspiration, on the contrary are associated with greater ideals and with distant future, which may seem odd to speak of a baby’s aspiration to drink their mothers’ milk. Yet, as we will see, a basic and immediate desire and a greater abstract goal can be put on the same level of importance in given circumstances. Moreover, I argue–and this is one of the main point of this book—that we define distant and abstract aspirations through the same process than we define basic and personal ones: by our capabilities on perceived affordances.
