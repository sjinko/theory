# Components of the model

This chapter present the conceptual components of the ethics model:
* Aspirations
* Affordances
* Capabilities

## Aspirations
Aspirations is a universal concept that describes a human reality: desire. From the moment we are born, we desire. The desire not to be exposed to light, the desire for warth, the desire for food. Of course, only later can we begin conceptualizing, discerning and naming these desires, but this do not mean they do not exist from the moment we come into this world.

With time, our desire multiplies. We start wanting to be held, to be talked to, and to move things. Soon, we want affection, we crave certain food, we want to play with our toys. As we grow older, these aspirations become more abstract, like going to college, traveling, meeting the right person, etc.

While many of our aspirations concerns us, we also desire things for others. We desire our parents to be in good health and that friend to get the job they applied for. Aspirations can, in that sense, be selfless. The people we aspire for can be individuals but also groups. Hence, I can aspire for my students to suceed and find good jobs. I might project these aspirations unto them individually, in accordance to my relationship with each and everyone of them, but I also project these aspiration unto them as a group. Hence, the type of group can be more or less defined. For example, a given group of students is defined, while all students I have is slightly more abstract. I might want for all students — regardless if taught them or not — to succeed. 

While our feeling of desire might be bigger for ourselves and those we love, we also aspire the best for strangers... specific conflicts, society, etc.

Our desire may even apply to non-humans such as pet, or wild life, flora, and the environement. 

In general, aspirations follow two evolutionary paths: one concerns the distance to the self, and the second the degree of abstraction. In [Table 1], I give four examples that illustrate the range of aspirations from basic to abtract and from personal to distant. Unsurprisingly, basic aspirations correspond to those that we develop at an early stage in our life. These also correspond to the “basic needs” such as eating, clothing and shelter. The most basic personal aspirations are somewhat universal. On the other hand, aspirations for distant entities and abstract aspirations vary greatly from one individual to another. 

### Table 1: Aspiration matrix
|          | Basic               | Abstract        |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Personal | Drinking water      | Going to heaven |
| Distant  | No animal suffering | Sustainability  |

The distinction between “aspirations”, “desires” and “wants” may seem thin, and it is. The reason why I use aspirations has to do with the seemingly more abstract nature of the notion. We often associate “desire” with a feeling or an uncontrolable urge. Wants are often opposed to needs, making them seem unecessary, superflous or frivolous. Aspiration, on the contrary are associated with greater ideals and with distant future, which may seem odd to speak of a baby’s aspiration to drink their mothers’ milk. Yet, as we will see, a basic and immediate desire and a greater abstract goal can be put on the same level of importance in given circumstances. Moreover, I argue–and this is one of the main point of this book—that we define distant and abstract aspirations through the same process than we define basic and personal ones: by our capabilities on perceived affordances.

## Where aspirations and desire split
Aspirations can be based on desire, but not only. They can also be based on obligation or constraint.

## Aspirations are linked
One aspiration may lead to another. If I want to be successful, it might push me to want to make money, therefore have a good job, therefore go to university. Yet, I might also, instead of wanting to have a job, want to make a lot of money without going to university. 

## Building on aspirations
Aspirations can also be built from the bottom up.

## Introducing discrimination
The example of students is a good one because it allows me to introduce some bias. I might want all my students to succeed or all students to suceed, or I may think that only hard-working students should succeed. Instead, I could also aspire for all hard-working and naturally talented students to succeed. Why should students who are naturally gifted and do not have to work hard should fail?

Any aspiration discreminates. When I want something for myself, I want it for me, not for others. If I want something good to happen to my family or to some friends, I don’t wish it necessarily as muhc for other people. I may want the same for everybody, but let‘s just say I don’t care as much. Inversely, I may want something for strangers, but not necessarilly for people that I know. I may consider they don’t deserve it, or that it is no use to them.

## Priorizing aspirations
Not all aspirations are equal. We consider some aspiration of greater importance. Succeeding in life may seem to us more important than going for a burger. 

## Priority is contextual
We may favor one aspiration — say eating something when I am hungry — over another like going for a hike, even though I also want to hike. The way we prioritze aspirations is not absolute, but has to do with context. We would priorize our aspiration to eat if we are starving, over something we deem of greater importance like being true to a friend. Yet, we sometime face these situation where little things take a disproportionate size, as we say. 

## Aspirations depend on context
Let’s say I walk down the street. If the street happens to be by the parc, I may want to stroll thorugh the automn leaves. If on the street there is a store that caugh my eye, I might enter inside and buy something, something I had never thought of.  

## Modeling aspirations
Aspirations are virtual realities.

## Morality / Normative Ethics
Morality is the collectively defined hierarchy of aspirations. Morality help us navigate our aspirations, it’s to get rid of the need to think for ourselves. Hedonism tells us we have to prioritze our bodily aspirations. Utilitarism tells us to prioritize the many aspirations of the most people as possible.
