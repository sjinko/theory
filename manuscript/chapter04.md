# Components of the model

This chapter present the conceptual components of the ethics model:
* Aspirations
* Affordances
* Capabilities

## Aspirations
Aspirations is a universal concept that describes a human reality: desire. From the moment we are born, we desire. The desire not to be exposed to light, the desire for warth, the desire for food. Of course, only later can we begin conceptualizing, discerning and naming these desires, but this do not mean they do not exist from the moment we come into this world.

With time, our desire multiplies. We start wanting to be held, to be talked to, and to move things. Soon, we want affection, we crave certain food, we want to play with our toys. As we grow older, these aspirations become more abstract, like going to college, traveling, meeting the right person, etc.

While many of our aspirations concerns us, we may also desire things for others. We desire our parents to be happy, we want our friends to succeed...

While our feeling of desire might be bigger for ourselves and those we love, we also aspire the best for strangers... specific conflicts, society, etc.

Our desire may even apply to non-humans such as pet, or wild life, flora, and the environement. 

In general, aspirations follow two evolutionary paths: one concerns the distance to the self, and the second the degree of abstraction.

### Table 1: Afforance matrix
|          | Basic               | Abstract        |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Personal | Drinking water      | Going to heaven |
| Distant  | No animal suffering | Sustainability  |

In Table [chapter04-table01], I give for examples that illustrate basic personal, basic distant, abstract personal and abstract distant aspirations.
